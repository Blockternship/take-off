# The Social Coding "Blockternship" 
A distributed social hackathon....so what's that mean ðŸ¤” 

Well, when you have an open source project it's in your best interest to allow people from all over the world to contribute, afterall that's the meaning of open source, right? 

So our idea was to host a hackathon, where anyone could contribute, collaborate and create projects directly into one [organization](https://github.com/Blockternship) and we would fund bounties and provide code review in real time. 

Our goal with this invitingly open source initiative is to inspire and educate incoming developers! 

# The Run Down 

Aragon, Swarm City, Status and Giveth together with Chain Shot as the educational resource are forming an alliance to kick start aspiring developers through a 2 month distributed hackathon, our intention is to open up our communities by providing teaching sessions, education and bounties to anyone who wants to start #buidling on the Ethereum Blockchain.

### Does My Project Apply? 

We are pretty open minded when it comes to submissions, but there are a few requirements you'll need to consider. 

### Must Haves
- Be open source. 
- Be built on the Ethereum Blockchain. 
- Must not have external funding for development. 
- Deploy a working MVP to the [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/Blockternship)

If you don't know what to make or don't have an idea where to start, head over to http://socialcoding.tk/ to check out projects that are currently under developement or have come to fruition through the Social Coding Circle.
