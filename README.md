# The Social Coding "Blockternship" 
A distributed social hackathon....so what's that mean ðŸ¤” 

Well, when you have an open source project it's in your best interest to allow people from all over the world to contribute, afterall that's the meaning of open source, right? 

So our idea was to host a hackathon, where anyone could contribute, collaborate and create projects directly into one [organization](https://github.com/Blockternship) and we would fund bounties and provide review code in real time. 

Our goal with this invitingly open source initiative is to inspire and educate incoming developers! 

# The Run Down 

Aragon, Swarm City and Chain Shot and Giveth are forming an alliance to kick start aspiring developers through a 2 month distributed hackathon, our intention is to open up our communities by providing resources, education and bounties to anyone who wants to start building on the Ethereum Blockchain.

### Does My Project Apply? 

We are pretty open minded when it comes to submissions, but there are a few requirements you'll need to be considered. 

### Must Haves
- Be open source. 
- Be built on the Ethereum Blockchain. 
- Must not have external funding for development. 
- Deploy a working MVP to the [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/Blockternship)

If you don't know what to make or don't have an idea where to start, head over to http://socialcoding.tk/ to check out projects that are currently under developement or have come to fruition through the Social Coding Circle. 


### Here to Help
Whether you are new to blockchain development or a seasoned vet we want to provide support and learning during the process, so we have designated contact points inside each project for you to reach out to with your questions. 

### How to get started: 
- Submit an [issue](https://github.com/Blockternship/projects/issues/new?title=Your%20Amazing%20Ethereum%20Idea!!!&body=Tell%20us%20what%20your%20project%20is%20all%20about%20?) in the [Projects](https://github.com/Blockternship/projects) Repo 
- Then head over to [ChainShot](https://www.chainshot.com/) for all the tools you'll need to build you're own DApp. 

### Best way to reach teams:
- Connect directly with the members of the project you want to work with. 
- Start looking for contributors and asking technical questions in Riot:[Social Coding](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#giveth-social-coding:matrix.org)
